### 3. SOLID Principles

- [ ] Does each class have a single responsibility (SRP)?
- [ ] Can it be extended without modifying (OCP)?
- [ ] Do implementations fulfill their contracts (LSP)?
- [ ] Are interfaces specific, not "God Objects" (ISP)?
- [ ] Do we depend on interfaces, not implementations (DIP)?

**Verify**: Consult `.rules/solid-principles.mdc`

---

### 4. KISS Principle

- [ ] Is it the simplest solution that works?
- [ ] Is there no unnecessary over-engineering?
- [ ] Are there no abstractions "just in case"?

**Verify**: Consult `.rules/kiss-principle.mdc`

---

### 5. Code Conventions

- [ ] Do file names follow conventions (`*.entity.ts`, `*-usecase.ts`, etc.)?
- [ ] Do class names follow PascalCase?
- [ ] Do variables and functions follow camelCase?
- [ ] Are all parameters typed (no `any`)?
- [ ] Is code formatted with Prettier?

**Verify**: Consult `.rules/code-conventions.mdc`

---

### 6. MVP Scope

- [ ] Is the feature within MVP scope?
- [ ] Was `proyect_requirements.md` consulted before adding?
- [ ] Were no features from the "Explicitly Out" list added?

**Features explicitly out**:
- ❌ Payments
- ❌ Appointment cancellation or rescheduling
- ❌ Automatic prior reminders
- ❌ Chats between users
- ❌ Admin panel
- ❌ Advanced calendar handling
- ❌ Multi-currency or internationalization

**Verify**: Consult `proyect_requirements.md` and `.rules/roadmap.mdc`

---

### 7. Dependency Injection

- [ ] Do use cases depend on interfaces, not implementations?
- [ ] Are providers configured in `interfaces/providers.ts`?
- [ ] Are there no circular dependencies?

**Verify**: Consult `.rules/dependency-injection.mdc`

---

### 8. Anti-Patterns

- [ ] No "God Objects"?
- [ ] Do entities have business logic (not anemic)?
- [ ] No circular dependencies?
- [ ] No magic numbers/strings?
- [ ] No premature optimization?

**Verify**: Consult `.rules/anti-patterns.mdc`

---

### 9. Testing (Optional but Recommended)

- [ ] Are there tests for the new logic?
- [ ] Are tests clear and descriptive?
- [ ] Do tests follow the AAA structure (Arrange-Act-Assert)?

**Verify**: Consult `.rules/testing.mdc`

---

### 10. Clean Architecture - General Verification

- [ ] Is domain free of frameworks?
- [ ] Do use cases orchestrate without directly depending on infrastructure?
- [ ] Are controllers thin (only call use cases)?
- [ ] Do dependencies follow the correct flow?

**Verify**: Consult `.rules/clean-architecture.mdc`

## Useful Commands Before Commit

### Format Code
```bash
npm run format
```

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Build (Verify it compiles)
```bash
npm run build
```

## If Something Fails in the Checklist

### DO NOT Commit Until:
1. Fix violations
2. Verify code compiles
3. Run tests (if they exist)
4. Pass the complete checklist

### Correction Priorities:

1. **CRITICAL** (blocks commit):
   - Dependency violations (domain importing from other layers)
   - Features outside MVP
   - Incorrect folder structure

2. **IMPORTANT** (fix before merge):
   - SOLID violations
   - Anti-patterns
   - Code conventions

3. **RECOMMENDED** (improve in next iteration):
   - Missing tests
   - Readability improvements
   - Minor optimizations

---

## Final Notes

- **Better a small and correct commit than a large and problematic one**
- **Rules are to maintain quality and architecture**
- **If you have doubts, consult the corresponding `.rules/*.mdc` files**

---

## Quick Checklist (Summary Version)

For small/urgent commits, verify at least:

- [ ] Correct dependencies? (domain does not import from other layers)
- [ ] File in correct folder?
- [ ] Feature within MVP?
- [ ] Code formatted and no compilation errors?

If all are ✅, you can proceed with commit. Then, in review, verify the complete checklist.
